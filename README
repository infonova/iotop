Iotop is a Python program with a top like UI used to show of behalf of which
process is the I/O going on. It requires Python >= 2.7 and a Linux kernel >=
2.6.20 with the CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT CONFIG_TASKSTATS,
CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING and CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS options on.


To run a local version of iotop:

$ ./iotop.py


The documentation is available in the man page:

$ man ./iotop.8


To install iotop, you should use a package provided by your distribution. If you
really want to install this version of iotop on your system, do (as root):

# ./setup.py install


To run in docker do something like:

# docker run -it --rm --net host --pid host --cap-add NET_ADMIN infonova/iotop:0.6

To group processes a configuration yaml configuration file can be defined with the --config parameter.
The groups are defined in the process_groups with a name and a filter pattern.
Everything that is not defined there is added to a group with the  default_process_group
name.

    Example configuration file:

    default_process_group: "Others"
    process_groups:
      - name: "Kernel"
        pattern: "^\\[.+$"
      - name: "Zuul"
        pattern: ".*(zuul|nodepool|git).*"
      - name: "Artifactory"
        pattern: ".*(artifactory|nginx).*"
      - name: "Elastic"
        pattern: ".*elasticsearch.*"
